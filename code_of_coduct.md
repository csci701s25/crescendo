# Summary

## Data Privacy:
- Allow users to choose their preferred visibility: off, close friends, followers, public
- In public view and followers' view, users will never see markers with other users' locations.
- Spotify asks for permissions when authenticating
- Ask for permission when opening the browser for authentication and when asking for foreground location
- Will construct a data notice outlining what data is being stored in our backend, what it could be possibly used for, and by who
